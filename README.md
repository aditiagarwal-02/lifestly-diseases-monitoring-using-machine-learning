# DATA-DRIVEN MACHINE LEARNING FRAMEWORK FOR MONITORING LIFESTYLE DISEASES USING WEARABLE ACTIVITY SENSORS

The rising prevalence of lifestyle diseases is closely intertwined with the growing prevalence of sedentary lifestyles.
Modern conveniences, coupled with technological advancements, have led to a significant reduction in physical activity
levels for many individuals. Understanding and addressing the impact of sedentary behavior on health is paramount in the context of lifestyle
disease prevention. Innovative approaches to monitor and manage individual health must account for the challenges
of sedentary lifestyles. This includes tracking overall physical activity levels and promoting strategies to break up
prolonged periods of sitting, encouraging regular movement, and fostering a culture of physical well-being in both
professional and personal spheres.
Broadly, our project focuses on the following three objectives:
• Develop an end-to-end data-driven machine learning pipeline for user-specific personalized recommendations.
• Focus on four primary diseases that occur due to a sedentary lifestyle,CVD, COPD, Diabetes and obesity.
• Enable real-time user data collection using wearable activity sensors.
